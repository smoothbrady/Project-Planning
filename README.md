# Project-Planning
My proeject is called "Space Floppy Bird" almost like a recreation of the game Flappy Bird.


I will have to create a function that will create initially a grvaity system for the ship to action "fly."
Also create functions to randomize the blocks to be at different heights from the top of the screen 
as well as the bottom.
I will also create a jump function that will go hand in hand with the function i create for gravity.

As a user I need to find a background that fits my app
As a user i need to also create or find a spaceship that will participate as our player
As a user I will have to seek specific gravity difficulty
